<h2>Origins of symphony</h2>
<img src="symphony.jpg"width="500">
<p>The word symphony is derived from the Greek word συμφωνία (symphonia),
<br> meaning "agreement or concord of sound",
<br>"concert of vocal or instrumental music", from σύμφωνος (symphōnos),
<br>"harmonious".[1] The word referred to a variety of different concepts
<br>before ultimately settling on its current meaning designating a musical form.
<br>In late Greek and medieval theory, the word was used for consonance,
<br>as opposed to διαφωνία (diaphōnia), which was the word for "dissonance".
<br>[2] In the Middle Ages and later, the Latin form symphonia was used to
<br>describe various instruments, especially those capable of producing more
<br>than one sound simultaneously.[2] Isidore of Seville was the first to use
<br>the word symphonia as the name of a two-headed drum, and from c. 1155 to
<br>1377 the French form symphonie was the name of the organistrum or
<br>hurdy-gurdy. In late medieval England, symphony was used in both of
<br>these senses, whereas by the 16th century it was equated with the
<br>dulcimer. In German, Symphonie was a generic term for spinets and
<br>virginals from the late 16th century to the 18th century.[3]
<br>In the sense of "sounding together," the word begins to appear in the titles
<br>of some works by 16th- and 17th-century composers including Giovanni
<br>Gabrieli's Sacrae symphoniae, and Symphoniae sacrae, liber secundus,
<br>published in 1597 and 1615, respectively; Adriano Banchieri's Eclesiastiche sinfonie, dette canzoni in aria francese, per sonare, et cantare, op. 16, published in 1607; Lodovico Grossi da Viadana's Sinfonie musicali, op. 18, published in 1610; and Heinrich Schütz's Symphoniae sacrae, op. 6, and Symphoniarum sacrarum secunda pars, op. 10, published in 1629 and 1647, respectively. Except for Viadana's collection, which contained purely instrumental and secular music, these were all collections of sacred vocal works, some with instrumental accompaniment.[4][5]
In the 17th century, for most of the Baroque period, the terms symphony and sinfonia were used for a range of different compositions, including instrumental pieces used in operas, sonatas and concertos—usually part of a larger work. The opera sinfonia, or Italian overture had, by the 18th century, a standard structure of three contrasting movements: fast, slow, fast and dance-like. It is this form that is often considered as the direct forerunner of the orchestral symphony. The terms "overture", "symphony" and "sinfonia" were widely regarded as interchangeable for much of the 18th century.[5]
In the 17th century, pieces scored for large instrumental ensemble did not precisely designate which instruments were to play which parts, as is the practice from the 19th century to the current period. When composers from the 17th century wrote pieces, they expected that these works would be performed by whatever group of musicians were available. To give one example, whereas the bassline in a 19th-century work is scored for cellos, double basses and other specific instruments, in a 17th-century work, a basso continuo part for a sinfonia would not specify which instruments would play the part. A performance of the piece might be done with a basso continuo group as small as a single cello and harpsichord. However, if a bigger budget was available for a performance and a larger sound was required, a basso continuo group might include multiple chord-playing instruments (harpsichord, lute, etc.) and a range of bass instruments, including cello, double bass, bass viol or even a serpent, an early bass woodwind instrument.
